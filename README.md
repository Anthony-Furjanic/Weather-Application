# Weather-Application

##PROJECT STATUS
Ran out of time to complete project at this time, so project is still being worked on

##description
This application allows the user to check the weather for today at their location as well as for the next four days.  It was originally intended to allow the user to pull a 5 day forecast but I could not figure out how to use the API to pull data for the 5th day 



##usage
User loads page, then allows location to be determined, then user can see weather for the next 4 days.   Also user has the ability to search a city in the search box (although I also could not get that aspect working either)
